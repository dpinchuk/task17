                    <strong>An architect</strong> is someone who plans, designs, and reviews the construction of buildings.
                    To practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design of buildings and
                    the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human
                    occupancy or use. Etymologically, architect derives from the Latin architectus, which derives from
                    the Greek (arkhi-, chief+ tekton, builder), i.e., chief builder.
